# Who's That Pok√©mon - JS Vanilla üÉè‚ú®

Welcome! üëã  
This repository contains the source code for my **"Who's That Pok√©mon"** game, built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS3**, and **AJAX requests** to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The game is a card-based recreation of the classic **"Who's That Pok√©mon?"** from the original Pok√©mon TV series.

The game was developed 100% on the **Frontend** as part of the **Web Development in Client-Side Environment** course in the **Advanced Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*). It was created using **JavaScript functions**, **LocalStorage** for data persistence, and **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for styling. üéÆüåü

## About Me üíª

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** with a passion for web development, especially in creating engaging and interactive frontend experiences. While my main focus is backend development, I enjoy working with **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **UI/UX design** for frontend challenges. This project allowed me to explore and deepen my skills in these areas!

I first fell in love with programming during my studies in the **Higher Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*), and I've continued developing my skills ever since. This game is a fun example of how I apply what I've learned to create interactive experiences! ‚ú®

## Project Highlights üåê

The **Who's That Pok√©mon** game was developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes the following key features:

- üÉè **Card-based Gameplay**: Players guess the Pok√©mon's name based on its silhouette. The game validates the answer and tracks progress.
- ‚ö° **AJAX Requests**: Real-time data fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve Pok√©mon information dynamically.
- üíæ **LocalStorage Persistence**: Saves player scores, progress, and game state to LocalStorage, ensuring continuity even after page refreshes.
- üé® **CSS3 Layout**: The game is styled using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, ensuring a responsive and attractive design for both desktop and mobile users.

## Game Rules üéÆ

The goal of the game is to guess the name of the Pok√©mon displayed in the silhouette on the card. Once you type the name and hit "Enter", the game will validate if the answer is correct or not. If correct, the Pok√©mon will be revealed and added to your completed Pok√©mon count. If not, you can try again, but if the silhouette fades without revealing the Pok√©mon, it means the game has randomly chosen to stop showing that particular Pok√©mon.

You can also track your performance by the following metrics:

- **Completed Pok√©mon**: The number of correct guesses you made.
- **Missing Pok√©mon**: The number of incorrect guesses or skipped Pok√©mon.
- **Time**: The total time spent (in milliseconds) to finish the game. The faster, the better!
- **Difficulty**: Choose from 5 levels of difficulty, each with an increasing number of Pok√©mon cards to guess.

Here are the levels:

- **Level 1**: 4 Pok√©mon cards to guess
- **Level 2**: 8 Pok√©mon cards to guess
- **Level 3**: 12 Pok√©mon cards to guess
- **Level 4**: 16 Pok√©mon cards to guess
- **Level 5**: 20 Pok√©mon cards to guess

## Why I Love Frontend Development ‚ù§Ô∏è

Frontend development offers an exciting blend of **creativity** and **logic**. It allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that's interactive and engaging for users. Here's a little JavaScript snippet to celebrate my passion for frontend coding:

```javascript
function showLove() {
    console.log("I <3 creating interactive and fun frontend experiences! üéÆüíª");
}
showLove();
```
